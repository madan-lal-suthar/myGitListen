or this example we will need to create three dummy coded variables. In general, with k groups there will be k-1 coded variables. Each of the dummy coded variables uses one degree of freedom, so k groups has k-1 degrees of freedom, just like in analysis of variance.

Here is how we will create the dummy variables which we will call d1, d2 and d3. For d1, every observation in group 1 will be coded as 1 and 0 for all other groups it will be coded as zero. We then code d2 with 1 if the observation is in group 2 and zero otherwise. For d3, observations in group 3 will be coded 1 and zero for the other groups. For d4, there is no d4. d4 is not needed because d1-d3 has all of the information needed to determine which observation is in which group.

Here is how the data look when arranged for use with a regression procedure.
